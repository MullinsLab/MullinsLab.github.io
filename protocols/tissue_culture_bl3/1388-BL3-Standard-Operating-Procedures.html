<h1>BL3 Standard Operating Procedures</h1>

<div id="intro">
<h1>I. Authorization to Use the Mullins&#39; lab BL-3 Facility (B44C)</h1>
<p><em>This document must be read and an agreement/authorization sheet signed
and registered with Dr. Mullins.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p> Entry to the BL-3 Facility is restricted to individuals who have
obtained prior approval. Authorization to use this facility is
contingent on the user&rsquo;s satisfactory completion of training,
understanding of the safety procedures described below, and on his
or her ability to follow these guidelines while using the facility.
Individuals with little or no prior experience working in a BL-3
facility must have an experienced individual working with them until
they become proficient in the safety techniques required.</p></li>
<li><p> Authorization to use the BL-3 facility requires review and
understanding of the following information:</p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> Practices outlined in the UW Biohazard Safety Manual, section IV
on Biohazard Control Procedures, section VI on Occupational
Health Program and section IX on Blood borne Pathogens.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><p> The pamphlet from the CDC-NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and
Biomedical Laboratories, pages 25-30, BL-3 Standard
Microbiological Practices, Special Practices and Safety
Equipment; and pages 116-121, Viral Agents: Retroviruses,
Including HIV and SIV. The information in this booklet contains
recent information on laboratory-acquired infection with HIV as
well as guidelines for the use of biological safety cabinets,
cleaning and decontaminating spills, and management of
exposures.</p></li>
<li><p> The specific rules and procedures outlined in this document for
work in the Rosen B44C BL-3 facility.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p> Authorization to use the BL-3 facility requires successful
completion of the following:</p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> Completion of the<a href="../bl3/BL3form_rev20060323.html">Mullins B44C BL-3 Facility Usage Authorization
Form</a>.
Make yourself a copy and turn in completed form to
Mullins/Mittler BL3 Lab supervisor (who will make a copy for BL3
Entry Notebook and give copies to appropriate supervisors).</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><p> Completion of the EHS course Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure
Control, required for laboratory employees working with human
blood and blood byproducts. Covers risk assessment, personal
protection, safe procedures, emergency response, and disposal of
biohazardous waste. Annual refresher training required. Register
online
at<a href="http://www.ehs.washington.edu/forms/classes/bpecrform.htm">http://www.ehs.washington.edu/forms/pso/bpecrform.php</a>or
call (206) 543-7201.</p></li>
<li><p> Completion of the EHS course, Biological Safety Practices (U
Conjoint 420), scheduled upon request, autumn only. If a user
already has extensive experience working in a BL-3 facility,
this course does not have to be taken prior to beginning their
work, but should be taken at the earliest possible convenience.</p></li>
<li><p> All users must have experience with tissue culture or working
with other human pathogens prior to working with HIV and SIV. A
laboratory orientation should be arranged with Dr. Mullins or
the BL-3 lab supervisor. At this time, proficiency in biosafety
techniques (use of the biosafety cabinets, microscopes,
centrifuge safety cups, and proper handling of media and waste
material, etc.) must be demonstrated.</p></li>
<li><p> Appointment with Occupational Health to cover the following:</p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> Hepatitis B immunization for work with blood or blood
products.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li> Counseling on working with HIV and SIV. This includes
receiving a drug prescription for post exposure prophylaxis
(PEP).</li>
<li> Drawing of serum sample prior to initiating work in the BL-3
facility. This sample will be stored in the event that HIV
seroconversion occurs in order to document the time of
seroconversion. They will not be tested without the consent
of the individual and then only after a documented exposure
occurs. Every 6 months samples can be drawn for HIV testing
(optional).</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h1>II. Entrance into the Facility</h1>

<ol>
<li> Food or drink is not permitted anywhere within the BL-3 laboratory
or anteroom.</li>
<li> Sandals and shorts are not allowed in the BL-3 facility.</li>
<li> Whenever possible, laboratory personnel should avoid handling
virus-containing material when he or she has cuts or skin abrasions
including, for example, eczema on the hands, wrists or face. If work
is necessary, and no replacement for that individual can be found to
perform the work, cuts and/or abrasions on the hands and/or wrists
should be thoroughly bandaged prior to donning gloves and entrance
to the facility. A full-face shield, in addition to the facemask,
should be worn to protect cuts and abrasions on the face.
Immuno-compromised individuals should not use the facility.</li>
<li> The following dress requirements are to be followed by all
individuals who use the facility regardless of the reason for entry:
within the anteroom and prior to entry to the facility each user
should put on one pair of nitrile gloves to cover at least two
inches of sleeve (the integrity of the gloves can be checked for
tears and punctures by flipping the gloves closed and observing that
the air trapped inside is not leaking). The user should then don
shoe covers, goggles (or glasses) and a face mask and enter the
facility. The gown should be put on immediately upon entrance to the
facility, followed by a second pair of latex long gloves. The inner
pair of gloves should never be removed or replaced while in the
facility unless a tear is suspected. Clean gowns will be provided in
the anteroom. Contaminated gowns should be changed immediately. It
should be emphasized that the reason for protective clothing is to
protect the worker from inadvertent spills of infected media. The
purpose of the shoe covers, for example, is to protect shoes from
inadvertent spills, however, THE FLOORS (AND ALL SURFACES) SHOULD BE
KEPT CLEAN OF SPILLS AND TRASH AT ALL TIMES. PROTECTIVE CLOTHING IS
NOT MEANT TO NOR WILL IT EVER REPLACE APPROPRIATE AND PRUDENT WORK
PRACTICES. Please note that the housekeeping staff are instructed
not to enter this room, you are responsible for keeping it clean.</li>
<li> The air pressure in the BL-3 facility should be between -0.05 and
-0.10. When the air pressure alarm sounds for a prolonged period of
time after entry into the facility and closing the door, all work in
the area should cease until the pressure has returned to normal.</li>
<li> Do not bring personal items into the lab.</li>
<li> Do not apply cosmetics while in the lab.</li>
<li> Workmen are only allowed to enter the facility if work is not
ongoing and with the approval of Dr. Mullins or the lab supervisor.
Workmen should be accompanied by someone authorized to enter the
BL-3 facility who will show them the appropriate dress requirements.
They should wear gowns and gloves but are not required to wear shoe
covers, goggles or facemask, as they will not handle infectious
materials.</li>
</ol>

<h1>III. Laboratory Procedures</h1>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>General Considerations:</strong></p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> Failure to comply with the practices described below will result
in suspension of access privileges.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li> Double gloves are required to provide protection against
exposure to virus through gloves potentially weakened by
alcohol, skin oils, other chemicals and overuse. EHS recommends
changing your outer gloves every 30 minutes. At any time the
outer gloves have been contaminated with culture supernatant,
serum or infectious fluid, they should be removed and discarded
into the autoclave bag inside the hood. A clean pair of outer
gloves should be donned before continuing work. Gloved hands
that have been working in the hood, should be sprayed with
ethanol or changed prior to touching anything outside of the
hood. It is recommended that you wash your hands free of oils
and remove rings with sharp edges prior to putting on gloves. To
take gloves off, take hold of the glove at the wrist and peel
off inside out.</li>
<li><p> Chemical disinfectants for bloodborne pathogens:<br>
Care should be taken to minimize splashing when applying
chemical disinfectants such as bleach, Wescodyne, or ethanol.  </p><p><a href="../bl3/bl3rulesuw.html#A">Appendix
A</a>describes
in detail our procedures for clean up of biohazard spills.  </p>
<ul>
<li><span class="underline"><strong>Chlorine Bleach</strong>(hypochlorite
solution ~6-8% hypochlorite)</span>: Use 2% (1:50 dilution
in water) for surfaces. Use 10% (1:10 dilution) for disposal
of liquids containing potentially hazardous pathogens or for
soaking heavily soiled tubes, vials etc. Use care - bleach
will corrode stainless steel. We use bleach routinely to mop
floors (1:50 dilution), for hood aspiration flasks (such
that full trap is a final of at least 1:10 bleach), and to
contain spills outside hood. Contact time should be at least
10 minutes.<br></li>
<li><span class="underline"><strong>Wescodyne</strong>(Iodophor compound -
0.175% Iodine)</span>: Use 1% (1:100 dilution in water) for
surfaces. Use 2.5% (1:40 dilution) for disposal of liquids
containing potentially hazardous pathogens or for soaking
heavily soiled tubes, vials etc. All spills inside hood
should be disinfected immediately with 2.5% Wescodyne
followed by with 70% ethanol (Wescodyne is corrosive to
stainless steel though much less so than bleach; it should
not be used on aluminum or copper). We routinely use 2.5%
Wescodyne solution in disinfectant buckets, pipet jars, and
for spills and splashes inside or outside the hood. Contact
time should be at least 10 minutes. Dilute solutions for
soaking materials should be changed daily.<br></li>
<li><span class="underline"><strong>70% Ethanol</strong></span>: Used to
disinfected work surfaces, gloves, plastic surfaces, paper
notes, instrument surfaces, and all surfaces where bleach or
Wescodyne are inappropriate due to their corrosive and
staining characteristics. DO NOT SPRAY ethanol directly into
hood or into a spill; use a soaked paper towel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p> Aerosols:</p>
<ol>
<li> Procedures with a high potential for creating aerosols, such
as vigorous shaking and vortexing should be performed in the
back third of the biological safety cabinet.</li>
<li> Avoid pouring or decanting virus suspensions.</li>
<li> Avoid vigorous pipetting and mixing. Do not forcibly expel
the last drop of suspension from a pipette. Discharge
pipetted material near the surface of fluid or down the wall
of a tube.</li>
<li> When opening culture tubes, bottles and flasks, manipulate
them slowly.</li>
<li> When resuspending liquid cultures, use a gentle swirling
action to create a homogeneous suspension. Once cultures are
resuspended, wait a few minutes before opening the
container.</li>
<li> Do not spray or pour disinfectants directly onto liquid
spills. Place absorbent paper towels over spill, then pour
10% bleach or 2.5% Wescodyne around and onto towels.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p> GLASSWARE: Whenever possible, plasticware should be used. Avoid
use of glassware.</p></li>
<li><p> SHARPS: Hypodermic needles, razor blades, glass Pasteur pipettes
and other sharps which can easily penetrate the skin are
forbidden in the BL-3 facility unless their use is absolutely
necessary and specific permission for their use is obtained from
Dr. Mullins.</p></li>
<li><p> MOUTH PIPETTING: Mouth pipetting is not permitted. Use of a
mechanical pipetting device is required.</p></li>
<li><p> VACUUM: Vacuum lines must be protected with high efficiency
particulate air (HEPA) filters and liquid disinfectant traps
(containing 10% -100% bleach).</p></li>
<li><p> Avoid touching your face or any other exposed skin while in the
BL-3 facility.</p></li>
<li><p>Before using the phone, change outer gloves to clean pair. Swab
phone with 70% ethanol after use.</p></li>
<li><p>To avoid contamination of an entire notebook, write notes and
data in pencil or ethanol resistant pen on single sheets of
paper or paper towels. These can then be saturated with ethanol
before removing from the BL-3 lab. Protocols brought into the
BL-3 lab should be enclosed in a vinyl page protector so that
they can be cleaned with ethanol.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p> <strong>Work in Biosafety Cabinets</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> The biosafety cabinet (class II, type A) is not designed for the
use of volatile toxic chemicals and volatile radionuclides and
therefore they cannot be used in this facility.</li>
<li> The height of the user&rsquo;s chair should be adjusted to allow
comfortable working and prevent a direct line of exposure to the
user&rsquo;s face during normal operation of the hood.</li>
<li> DO NOT TURN THE HOOD BLOWER OFF AT ANY TIME.</li>
<li> MANIPULATIONS OF POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS MATERIAL shall be
conducted in the laminar-flow biosafety cabinets as follows:

<ul>
<li>Each user must clean the hood surfaces with 70% ethanol
before initiation of work and after completion of work.</li>
<li>Upon completion of work and your exit from BL3, the hood
should be clean and free of all material except the
followingPERMANENT HOOD RESIDENTS: tip boxes, pipettors,
marker, aspiration flask, bleach bottle.<strong>BEFORE LEAVING THE
BL3 CLEAN OUT YOUR WESCODYNE WASTE AND LEAVE EMPTY BUCKET BY
SINK FOR NEXT USER.</strong>If you have extenuating circumstances
for leaving other items in the hood LEAVE A NOTE WITH YOUR
NAME, TIMEDATE, AND WHEN YOU EXPECT TO RETURN TO CLEAN UP!</li>
<li>Place bucket (no more than Â¾ full) of fresh 2.5% Wescodyne
solution in hood.</li>
<li>Check aspiration flask. Aspirated liquid waste is collected
and disinfected in a 2 L aspiration flask charged with 200
mL undiluted bleach. After aspiration of infectious
materials, chase with bleach then 70% ethanol. Empty into
sink when ~Â¾ full; recharge with 200 mL undiluted bleach.</li>
<li>Manipulations should be performed as far back from the front
air grill as practical. Avoid placing anything on the front
or rear grills of the cabinet since these will disrupt the
airflow pattern and defeat the purpose of the cabinet.</li>
<li>Biological wastes must be exposed to 10% bleach or 2.5%
Wescodyne for at least minutes before sink disposal. NOTE:
Plastic tips and tubes/vials should be completely submerged
and pipettes should be filled to just below the plug. Upon
your final exit from the hood, decontaminated plastic
pipettes should be transferred to pipette jar. The Wescodyne
waste bucket should sprayed with ethanol, the contents
strained over the sink, and plastics discarded in small
biohazard bag.</li>
<li>Radioactive liquid waste will be disinfected with 10% bleach
in a separate bleach trap and then transferred to the main
lab and treated as general radioactive waste.</li>
</ul></li>
<li> TRANSPORT OF POTENTIALLY BIOHAZARDOUS MATERIALS (tubes for
centrifugation, culture dishes to be placed in incubators or
observed under microscope, etc&hellip;) should not leave the hood
without being properly sealed. Microscope slides containing
infectious materials should be transported and observed within
plastic petri dishes and examined while remaining within this
container if possible.</li>
<li> AVOID AEROSOLIZATION: Care should be taken to minimize the
splatter and/or aerosolization of infectious material inside the
hood (e.g. pipette tips should be ejected only when the tip is
present wholly within the confines of a plastic vessel
containing appropriate disinfectant).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p> <strong>Centrifugation</strong></p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> <span class="underline">Bench Top Centrifuge</span>: Avoid tube
collapse by matching the rated speed of the tube with the
requirements of your experiment. Make sure to use the
appropriate set of matched buckets for the type of tube being
used.

<ul>
<li>All centrifugation conducted outside of the biosafety
cabinets must be performed using sealed rotors or secondary
buckets to contain potential aerosols, leaks, and tube
breakage.</li>
<li>After centrifugation, the sealed rotor or buckets should be
opened only inside a biosafety cabinet. These containers are
disinfected in the hood by wiping out carefully with 70%
ethanol. They cannot be autoclaved.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li> <span class="underline">Microcentrifuge</span>: When
centrifuging infectious substances, the microcentrifuge should
be transferred into the hood for use and surface decontaminated
prior to removal.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p> <strong>Using the Microscope</strong></p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> Tighten caps on flasks of infectious culture before transporting
to the microscope. Infectious cultures in plates or other
containers without snugly fitting lids should be carried to the
microscope in a tray.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li> When using the hemacytometer to count cells, enclose the
hemacytometer in a clean/disinfected petri dish with lid for
transport to the microscope and observation.</li>
<li> Change or spray gloves with ethanol before touching the
microscope.</li>
<li> Disinfect the viewing platform of the microscope after each use.</li>
<li> If you must remove your safety glasses to look through the
scope, don&rsquo;t forget to replace them.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p> <strong>Waste Management</strong></p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> SHARPS:

<ul>
<li>Pipette tips and plastic pipettes are treated as
quasi-sharps because they can puncture autoclave bags.
Therefore, after decontamination and straining/draining,
they must be double-bagged before autoclaving.</li>
<li>Metal sharps that will easily penetrate the skin are not
allowed in the BL-3 facility without special permission.
Upon completion of the work after at least a 30-minute
exposure to bleach, the decontaminated sharps are
transferred to a red sharps container to await autoclaving.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li> SOLID WASTE other than sharps generated inside the hood (vials,
tubes, culture flasks, etc.) should be decontaminated, drained
then placed directly into the large biohazard bag to await
autoclaving. Solid wastes generated outside the hood (paper
towels, outer gloves, shoe covers, etc.) are placed directly
into the large biohazard bag to await autoclaving.</li>
<li> LIQUID WASTE collected in a bleach trap or a 2.5% Wescodyne
solution within the biosafety cabinet must be exposed to
disinfectant 10 minutes before sink disposal.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Waste Sterilization</strong></p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> All solid waste and glassware should be autoclaved for at least
60 minutes at 132Â°C. Liquid waste must be autoclaved for at
least 60 minutes per gallon at 121Â°C. Laundry should be
autoclaved for 30 minutes at 121Â°C.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li> All material to be autoclaved should have appropriate autoclave
tape attached to confirm that the correct temperature was
attained.</li>
<li> A chemical indicator (i.e. steristrip) is placed in the center
of EACH LOAD to confirm proper decontamination conditions.
Biological testing systems are required at monthly intervals.
Records of the temperature, time, results of chemical indicators
and biological testing systems must be maintained for each load
of waste autoclaved for one year.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Identification and Storage of Materials</strong></p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> All equipment and materials in the BL-3 facility should be
treated as if they are contaminated.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li> Storage vessels containing biohazardous materials including
cultures in incubators and refrigerators and freezers should be
labeled to identify their contents, owners, and date.</li>
<li> All equipment such as refrigerators, freezers, incubators, cell
counters, centrifuges, etc. used for or containing biohazardous
materials must be labeled clearly with the appropriate
biohazards symbol.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Laboratory Transport</strong></p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> Live infectious materials, which are removed from the facility
for storage in liquid nitrogen or -70Â°C freezers should be
stored in nonbreakable, cryovials with rubber gasket seals. The
vials are surface decontaminated with 70% ethanol after sealing
and then transported to the freezers in nonbreakable,
impermeable closed containers with biohazard symbols. These
containers are assembled and then surface decontaminated prior
to exit from the facility.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h1>IV. Exiting the Facility</h1>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>Prior to exiting the facility,</strong>each user should check to ensure
that he or she has:</p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> Appropriately cleaned and disinfected all work areas</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><p> Organized tools/supplies into correct storage location</p></li>
<li><p> Disposed of generated waste in the proper manner</p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> If the solid waste bag is Â¾ full, it must be secured with a
single wrap with rubber band and placed in autoclave tray by
door. If enough autoclave trays are filled, run autoclave.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li> If the sharps container is full, it is to be surface
decontaminated, transferred to the anteroom, tagged with
autoclave tape and autoclaved.</li>
<li> When pipette jar outside hood is Â¾ full, the pipettes are
to be removed from the tank and allowed to drain in the
sink. The pipettes are double-bagged before autoclaving.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p> Adjusted the water level in the water bath and confirmed that
the temperature is set for 37Â°C</p></li>
<li><p> Turned off the aspirator and mechanical pipettor</p></li>
<li><p> Turned off the microscope and centrifuges</p></li>
<li><p> Wiped down all used switches, handles, and control panels with
70% ethanol</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p> Before exiting the work area, users should remove their protective
gear in the following order:</p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> 1. Shoe covers (spray shoe soles with ethanol)</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li> 2. Outer gloves (spray inner gloves with ethanol)</li>
<li> 3. Mask</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>EXIT THE WORK AREA</p>
<ol>
<li> In the anteroom remove:

<ol>
<li> goggles</li>
<li> gown</li>
<li> inner gloves</li>
</ol></li>
<li> Shoe covers, gloves and masks are disposable and should be placed in
the solid waste bins. should be placed in the appropriate bin
(yellow bags) in the anteroom to await autoclaving.</li>
<li> Hands should be washed in the anteroom prior to leaving the
facility.</li>
</ol>

<h1>V. Emergency Procedures</h1>

<ol>
<li><p> Laboratory Accidents</p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> <span class="underline">Personal Injury or Exposure</span>: All
equipment in the BL-3 facility should be treated as if it were
contaminated. Any cuts or abrasions obtained while in the
facility should be immediately scrubbed for 10 minutes with 1%
Wescodyne, soap and water. For mucous membrane exposure,
thoroughly flush the surface for several minutes. There is an
eye wash fountain located in the BL-3 facility. The user should
then exit the facility using appropriate exiting procedures and
seek immediate medical attention with the Occupational Health
nurse practitioner, room NN256A; phone number (206) 548-4848. If
the accident occurs after hours, go directly to the UW Medical
Center emergency room. The occupational nurse/emergency room
will evaluate the wound, draw a blood sample and give any
necessary treatment; including HAART. The incident should be
reported to Dr. Mullins or the lab supervisor and an Accident
Report Form filed with EHS within 24 hours of the exposure.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li> <span class="underline">Centrifuge Malfunctions</span>:
Centrifuge malfunctions should be handled in such a way as to
avoid personal injury or exposure. If an imbalance occurs or a
bucket is thrown from the rotor, the unit should immediately be
turned off. Even in non-emergency situations, centrifugation is
a procedure that is potentially hazardous when working with
biohazardous material. Aerosols can be detected during the
filling of centrifuge tubes, removal of caps or removal of
contents. Breakage of tubes during centrifugation produces the
greatest amount of aerosol. Safety sealed centrifuge cups will
not allow the escape of contents or an aerosol in the event of
an accident, provided that they are sealed properly and only
opened in a biological safety cabinet.</li>
<li> <span class="underline">Fire Alarm</span>: If working with live
materials, the cultures should be returned to the incubator and
the facility should be exited using the appropriate exiting
procedures.</li>
<li> <span class="underline">Earthquake</span>: Flying glass from the
hood and sliding or falling heavy equipment are the primary
dangers during an earthquake. Move immediately away from the
front of the hood, freezer and stacked incubator. Stand flush
against the wall. Watch for falling equipment and supplies. Some
users may be able to duck under the knee space on the hood,
which will lend some protection from overhead. After the
earthquake, survey the area for biological or chemical spills;
clean the spills only if the area is safe. If the area is not
safe and the spill occurred in the hood, remove the lid of the
dilute Wescodyne solution and overturn it in the hood. Leave as
quickly as possible following the appropriate exit procedures.
If there is time, leave a note on the door stating that a
biological spill has occurred.</li>

<p><span id="A"></span></p><p><strong>APPENDIX A - CLEAN-UP OF BIOHAZARDOUS SPILLS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p> <strong>Biohazardous Spills in the Biological Safety Cabinet</strong><br>
Chemical decontamination procedures should be initiated at once
while the cabinet continues to operate to prevent escape of
contaminants from the cabinet.</p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> It is best to soak the spill into paper towels and pour 2.5%
Wescodyne such that it seeps into the paper towels rather than
pouring directly onto the spill and generating aerosols. Allow
the detergent to act for 10 minutes then transfer soaked paper
towels to an autoclave bag within the hood. Wipe walls, work
surfaces, and equipment with detergent. The operator should be
in protective gear during this procedure.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li> If the spill has spread to the catch basin underneath the front
grill, wipe the grill with 2.5% Wescodyne, remove the grill and
place it in the hood, soak up liquid in the catch basin with
paper towels, and disinfect with Wescodyne as in &ldquo;A&rdquo; above.
After paper towels have been removed, replace grill.</li>
<li> Seal and decontaminate the outside of the autoclave bag used to
collect the soaked paper towels, remove from the hood and
autoclave.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p> <strong>Biohazard Spill Outside of a Biological Safety Cabinet</strong></p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> Holding your breath leave the room immediately and close the
door.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li> Warn others not to enter the contaminated area. Post a sign on
the door if you leave the immediate vicinity.</li>
<li> In the anteroom, remove and properly dispose of contaminated
garments and protective gear. Thoroughly wash hands and face.</li>
<li> Wait 30 minutes to allow dissipation of aerosols created by the
spill.</li>
<li> Put on clean protective gear before reentering the room. If the
spill was of high titer virus, the use of a respirator and tight
fitting goggles should be considered.</li>
<li> Use paper towels to soak up the liquid. Then pour detergent
around the spill such that it flows into the towels. To minimize
aerosolization, avoid pouring directly into the spill.</li>
<li> Let stand 20 minutes to allow adequate disinfectant contact
time.</li>
<li> Using a dustpan and sponge or small broom transfer all
contaminated materials into an autoclave bag with as little hand
contact as possible. If there is broken glass involved, transfer
to a deep autoclave pan instead. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PICK UP ANY
BROKEN GLASS BY HAND!</li>
<li> Prepare a container of dilute detergent and sponge off the
floor, removing as much liquid as possible.</li>
<li>Autoclave waste along with the dustpan and sponge. If the broom
cannot be autoclaved, let it soak in 5% Wescodyne for 30 minutes
or more and then rinse.</li>
<li>Report the spill to Dr. Mullins or the BL-3 lab supervisor.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p> <strong>Radioactive Biohazard Spill Outside a Biological Safety Cabinet</strong></p></li>
<li><ol>
<li> Follow A-D from above. Before clean-up procedures begin, contact
a radiation safety officer (543-6328). The spill should be
surveyed for external radiation hazard prior to determining the
course of action.</li>
</ol></li>
